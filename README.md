# Chess.com Voice Input Facilitator

## About

This Google Chrome extension can be used on the [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) site and will allow you to simulate a mouse click on a given square by entering a two-digit coordinate into a pop-up form. This two-digit coordinate system is easy for your operating system's voice recognition software to recognize (versus something more traditional like algebraic notation), and you will also have to spend less effort announcing your moves.


## Special notes:

- The coordinate reference board, which can optionally be displayed or hidden within the pop-up form during a game, will show you all the valid coordinates from
  white's or black's perspective.
- The moment two non-whitespace characters are entered into the pop-up form, the form will automatically clear itself. This is intentional, so that you will 
  not have to take the extra step of saying something like "enter that" everytime you want a square clicked.
- You will know whether the value you entered into the form was a valid coordinate if your chosen square looks like a mouse clicked on it.
